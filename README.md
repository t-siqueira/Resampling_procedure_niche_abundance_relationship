Code to estimate the relationship between niche measures with local abundance and regional distribution

Because OMI niche metrics are dependent on abundance and distribution, we use a resampling procedure to get independent estimates of each variable. Basically, we split the whole data set in two - one is used to estimate niche metrics and the other to estimate abundance and distrbution.

We then estimate the relationship among those variables with linear models.
This approach was originally described in Siqueira et al. (2009) The role of niche measures in explaining the abundance–distribution relationship in tropical lotic chironomids. Hydrobiologia, 636, 163–172.

We also used a modified version of this approach in Rocha et al. (2018) Predicting occupancy and abundance by niche position, niche breadth and body size in stream organisms. Oecologia, 186 (1), 205-216.
